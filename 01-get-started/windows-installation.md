## 5- Using Git-Bash

* In this course I'll be using bash commands. Bash is just a command-line interface used in OS X and Linux. It's one of the most popular command-line interfaces. So, if you want to use it too, instead of using the Windows default command-line, you can use git bash that you've installed. With git bash, you can type a command in command-line as you're on OS X or Linux.

* If you don't want to use git bash, it's ok too. It depends on you. But note that, I'll be using bash commands mostly. Because it allows more advanced commands as well.

* You can also prefer to use the more powerful alternative to git bash: [Linux Subsystem for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

* **So, to use git bash, follow these steps:**
    1. Just search for git bash from the start bar
    2. Or, if there's one, click on the icon on your desktop

    3. Also, setup VS Code to use git-bash by default:
        1. Open VSÂ Code
        2. Go to Command Palette
            1. Type: `terminal`
            2. Select: _"Terminal: Select Default Shell"_
            3. And, Select: _"Git Bash"_

    4. **NOTE:** Normally, you can find your files under `c:\`, however, when you're using git bash, you'll find them under `/c/` directory. It's actually the very same directory, it's just a shortcut.

## That's all! Enjoy! ðŸ¤©
