# PROGRAMMER'S ROADMAP

Hi!

If you're an experienced developer, you may want to watch only the following lectures. If you follow this roadmap, you will need to watch about 50 lectures instead of 180 lectures.

This course starts from the most basics than advances toward the end, step by step. So, the complexity of the topics increases on each level. I've intentionally designed it so to make it easy for everyone. 

If you think some of the topics are easy for you, then watch the recap lectures, take the quizzes and exercises, and even skip the lectures in that section altogether, you can always come back to them later.

Enjoy!

# BONUS: Why should you learn Go?

**In summary:** Go is easy as Python and Javascript , and it's as fast as C/C++. It's more enjoyable to work with Go than C/C++. You can go low-level, or you can stay high-level.

## What Go is used for?

Go is used mostly by web companies: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Apple, Dropbox, Soundcloud, Medium, Mozilla Firefox, Github, Docker, Kubernetes, and Heroku.

**Go is best for:** Cross-Platform Command-line Tools, Distributed Network Applications, Cloud technologies like Microservices and Serverless, Web APIs, Database Engines, Big-Data Processing Pipelines, Embedded Development, and so on.

**Go is not best for (but doable):** Desktop Apps, Writing Operating Systems, Kernel Drivers, Game Development, etc.

## Who Designed Go?

Go designed by one of the most influential people in the industry:

* Unix:Â Ken Thompson
* UTF-8,Â Plan 9: Rob Pike
* HotspotÂ JVMÂ (Java Virtual Machine):Â Robert Griesemer

## [From Eight years of Go post](https://blog.golang.org/8years):

> Today,Â **every single cloud company has critical components of their cloud infrastructure implemented in Go**Â including Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, and many others. Go is a key part of cloud companies like Alibaba, Cloudflare, and Dropbox. Go is a critical part of open infrastructure including Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Openshift, NATS, Docker, Istio, Etcd, Consul, Juju, and many more. Companies are increasingly choosing Go, to build cloud infrastructure solutions.
