come night come romeo come thou day in night
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow on a raven's back
come gentle night come loving black-browed night
give me my romeo and when he shall die
take him and cut him out in little stars
and he will make the face of heaven so fine
that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun
oh I have bought the mansion of love
but not possessed it and though I am sold
not yet enjoyed
