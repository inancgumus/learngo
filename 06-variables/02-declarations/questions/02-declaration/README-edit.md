**Solution**: (B)

That's right! `four` is a valid variable name.

`int` is a reserved keyword for declaring the type of a variable. 

`2computers` is not valid because Go does not allow variables to start with a number. 

`one?there` is not valid because Go does not allow punctuation marks to be used in a variables name.
